# Smart-Parking-System-

𝐈𝐍𝐓𝐑𝐎𝐃𝐔𝐂𝐓𝐈𝐎𝐍:
             I have fabricated a prototype titled "SMART PARKING SYSTEM".

𝐀𝐁𝐒𝐓𝐑𝐀𝐂𝐓:

In today’s parking system, we have hydraulic lifts and a system that detects the amount 
for the number of hours, we parked the car But there is no FASTAG kind of system in 
parking places.

Therefore to avoid these situations, we have created a project named” SMART 
PARKING SYSTEM USING ARDUINO BOARD”. 

This project will be a starting point 
for automation parking.

In this project, we develop a code for the functioning of parking 
using the embedded C++ Language and fed it into the Arduino Board.

The car is detected 
at the starting point using Infrared Sensor and when the parking slot is full, it will not 
open the gate, When the parking slot is free, it will open the gate. This is the abstract of 
our project.

In the future, we will implement IoT technology to wirelessly communicate with Arduino 
Board and Image processing for better detection of cars

𝐂𝐎𝐍𝐂𝐋𝐔𝐒𝐈𝐎𝐍:

This is not a fully automated Smart Parking System.This project is a starting phase of Automation Parking.

Thereby from this project, the implementation of automation parking was 
kickstarted. 

There can be improvements apart from our project such as IoT implementation 
and Image Processing Technique which adds more facilities to this project in various 
circumstances. 

Therefore our project will help people to find out whether the parking slot is 
available or not. In future developments, the implementation of IoT and Image Processing 
Techniques that serves as an addon feature and feasibility to this parking system
