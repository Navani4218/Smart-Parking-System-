# Smart-Parking-System-
INTRODUCTION:
I have fabricated a prototype titled "SMART PARKING SYSTEM".

ABSTRACT:
In today’s parking system, we have hydraulic lifts and a system that detects the amount 
for the number of hours, we parked the car But there is no FASTAG kind of system in 
parking places.
Therefore to avoid these situations, we have created a project named” SMART 
PARKING SYSTEM USING ARDUINO BOARD”. 

This project will be a starting point 
for automation parking.
In this project, we develop a code for the functioning of parking 
using the embedded C++ Language and fed it into the Arduino Board.
The car is detected 
at the starting point using Infrared Sensor and when the parking slot is full, it will not 
open the gate, When the parking slot is free, it will open the gate. This is the abstract of 
our project.
In the future, we will implement IoT technology to wirelessly communicate with Arduino 
Board and Image processing for better detection of cars
